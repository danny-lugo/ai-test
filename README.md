Breeding ground for examples on how to interface C++ to Soar, Lua and Clips

Directories
-----------

* 3rdparty: contains include files and libraries for 3rd party dependencies, such as SOAR itself.

* build: using premake for creating Visual Studio/C++ projects and solutions. Run make.bat

* docs: collected documentation

* packages: a directory that contains related packages/libraries of interest.

* soartest1: simple test program of soar to spawn agents, a SOAR debugger, and exercise basic I/O.

Notes
------

* This is Windows only code - at this point.

* Add the 3rdparty/bin directory to your system PATH.  It's needed so the SOAR debugger can be found and executed correctly.
